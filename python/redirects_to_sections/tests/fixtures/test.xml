Some religious groups teach that he originated as an [[angel]] who fell out of favor with God, seducing humanity into the ways of [[sin]], and who has power in the fallen world. In the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]], Satan is primarily an accuser and adversary, a decidedly malevolent entity (a.k.a. the [[devil]]) who possesses demonic qualities.

In [[Theistic Satanism]], Satan is considered a positive force and deity who is either worshipped or revered. In [[LaVeyan Satanism]], Satan is regarded as holding virtuous characteristics.<ref>Contemporary Religious Satanisim: A Critical Reader, Jesper Aagaard Petersen - 2009</ref><ref>Who's ?

==Judaism==

===Hebrew Bible===
The original [[Hebrew]] term ''satan'' is a noun from a verb meaning primarily "to obstruct, oppose", as it is found in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 22:22, [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 29:4, [[Psalms]] 109:6.<ref>ed. [[George Arthur Buttrick|Buttrick, George Arthur]]; ''The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible, An illustrated Encyclopedia''</ref> ''Ha-Satan'' is traditionally translated as "the accuser" or "the adversary". The definite article ''ha-'' (English: "the") is used to show that this is a title bestowed on a being, versus the name of a being. Thus, this being would be referred to as "the satan".<ref>Crenshaw, James L. ''Harper Collins Study Bible'' (NRSV), 1989</ref>

====Thirteen occurrences====
''Ha-Satan'' with the [[definite article]] occurs 13 times in the [[Masoretic Text]], in two books of the Hebrew Bible: [[Book of Job|Job]] ch.1–2 (10x)<ref>Stephen M. Hooks – 2007 "As in Zechariah 3:1–2 the term here carries the definite article (has'satan="the satan") and functions not as a ... the only place in the Hebrew Bible where the term "Satan" is unquestionably used as a proper name is [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles 21:1]]."</ref> and [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 3:1–2 (3x).<ref name="ReferenceA">Coogan, Michael D.; ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its context'', Oxford University Press, 2009</ref>

''Satan'' without the definite article is used in 10 instances, of which two are translated ''diabolos'' in the Septuagint and "Satan" in the [[King James Bible|King James Version]]:
* 1 [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 21:1, "Satan stood up against [[Israel]]" (KJV) or "And there standeth up an adversary against Israel" ([[Young's Literal Translation]])<ref>Rachel Adelman ''The Return of the Repressed: Pirqe De-Rabbi Eliezer'' p65 "However, in the parallel versions of the story in Chronicles, it is Satan (without the definite article),"</ref>
* Psalm 109:6b "and let Satan stand at his right hand" (KJV)<ref>Septuagint 108:6 κατάστησον ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ἁμαρτωλόν καὶ διάβολος στήτω ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ</ref> or "let an accuser stand at his right hand." ([[English Standard Version|ESV]], etc.)

The other eight instances of ''satan'' without the definite article are traditionally translated (in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]] and English) as "an adversary", etc., and taken to be humans or obedient angels:
* [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 22:22,32 "and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him."
* 32 "behold, I went out to withstand thee,"
* 1 [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] 29:4 The Philistines say: "lest he [David] be an adversary against us"
* 2 Samuel 19:22 [[King David|David]] says: "[you sons of Zeruaiah] should this day be adversaries (plural) unto me?"
* 1 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 5:4 [[King Solomon|Solomon]] writes to [[Hiram I|Hiram]]: "there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent."
* 1 Kings 11:14 "And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, [[Hadad the Edomite]]"<ref>Ruth R. Brand Adam and Eve p88 – 2005 "Later, however, King Hadad 1 Kings 11:14) and King Rezon (verses 23, ... Numbers 22:22, 23 does not use the definite article but identifies the angel of YHWH as "a satan."</ref>
* 1 Kings 11:23 "And God stirred him up an adversary, [[Rezon the son of Eliadah]]"
* 25 "And he [Rezon] was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon"

====Book of Job====
[[File:Blake Book of Job Linell set 6.jpg|thumb|right|''The examination of Job'', Satan pours on the plagues of [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]], by [[William Blake]]]]

At the beginning of the book, [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] is a good person "who revered God and turned away from evil" (Job 1:1), and has therefore been rewarded by God. When the angels present themselves to God, Satan comes as well. God informs Satan about Job's blameless, morally upright character. Between Job 1:9–10 and 2:4–5, Satan points out that God has given Job everything that a man could want, so of course Job would be loyal to God; Satan suggests that Job's faith would collapse if all he has been given (even his health) were to be taken away from him. God therefore gives Satan permission to test Job.<ref>''HarperCollins Study Bible'' (NRSV)</ref> In the end, Job remains faithful and righteous, and there is the implication that Satan is shamed in his defeat.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steinmann|first1=AE|title=The structure and message of the Book of Job|journal=Vetus testamentum}}</ref>

===Second Temple period===

====Septuagint====
In the [[Septuagint]], the Hebrew ''ha-Satan'' in Job and [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] is translated by the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''diabolos'' (slanderer), the same word in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]] from which the English word [[devil]] is derived. Where ''satan'' is used of human enemies in the Hebrew Bible, such as [[Hadad the Edomite]] and [[Rezon the Syrian]], the word is left untranslated but transliterated in the Greek as ''satan'', a [[neologism]] in Greek.<ref>Henry Ansgar Kelly ''Satan: a biography'' 2006 "However, for Hadad and Rezon they left the Hebrew term untranslated and simply said ''satan''.. in the three passages in which a supra-Human satan appears: namely, Numbers, Job, Zechariah</ref> In Zechariah 3, this changes the vision of the conflict over [[Joshua the High Priest]] in the Septuagint into a conflict between "[[Jesus]] and the devil", identical with the Greek text of [[Book of Matthew|Matthew]].

====Dead Sea scrolls and Pseudepigrapha====
In Enochic [[Judaism]], the concept of Satan being an opponent of God and a chief evil figure in among demons seems to have taken root in Jewish [[pseudepigrapha]] during the [[Second Temple]] period,<ref name="Jackson,2">{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=David R.|title=Enochic Judaism|year=2004|publisher=T&T Clark International|location=London|isbn=0826470890|pages=2–4}}</ref> particularly in the ''apocalypses''.<ref name="Oxford,651"/>
The [[Book of Enoch]] contains references to [[Sathariel|Satariel]], thought also to be [[Sataniel]] and [[Satanel|Satan'el]] (etymology dating back to [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] origins). The similar spellings mirror that of his angelic brethren [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Raphael (angel)|Raphael]], [[Uriel]], and [[Gabriel]], previous to the [[Fallen angel|fall from Heaven]].

The [[2 Enoch|Second Book of Enoch]], also called the ''Slavonic Book of Enoch'', contains references to a [[Watcher (angel)|Watcher]] (Grigori) called Satanael.<ref>[[2 Enoch]] 18:3. On this tradition, see A. Orlov, "The Watchers of Satanael: The Fallen Angels Traditions in 2 (Slavonic) Enoch," in: A. Orlov, ''Dark Mirrors: Azazel and Satanael in Early Jewish Demonology'' (Albany: SUNY, 2011)85-106.</ref> It is a [[pseudepigraphic]] text of an uncertain date and unknown authorship. The text describes Satanael as being the prince of the Grigori who was cast out of heaven<ref>"And I threw him out from the height with his angels, and he was flying in the air continuously above the bottomless" - [[2 Enoch]] 29:4</ref> and an evil spirit who knew the difference between what was "righteous" and "sinful".<ref>"The devil is the evil spirit of the lower places, as a fugitive he made Sotona from the heavens as his name was Satanail, thus he became different from the angels, but his nature did not change his intelligence as far as his understanding of righteous and sinful things" – [[2 Enoch]] 31:4</ref> A similar story is found in the book of [[1 Enoch]]; however, in that book, the leader of the Grigori is called [[Samyaza|Semjâzâ]].

In the [[Book of Wisdom]], the devil is represented as the being who brought death into the world.<ref>See [http://books.google.com/books?id=TR0iC8EVUT0C&lpg=PA120&ots=lxUhG5NbYP&dq=satan%20book%20of%20wisdom&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q=devil%20death&f=false The Book of Wisdom: With Introduction and Notes, p. 27, ''Object of the book'', by A. T. S. Goodrick].</ref>

In the [[Book of Jubilees]], [[Mastema]] induces God to test [[Abraham]] through the sacrifice of [[Isaac]]. He is identical to Satan in both name and nature.<ref>[ Introduction to the Book of Jubilees, ''15. Theology. Some of our Author's Views: Demonology,'' by R.H. Charles.</ref>

===Rabbinical Judaism===
In Judaism, Satan is a term used since its earliest biblical contexts to refer to a ''human opponent''.<ref>Based on the [[Jewish exegesis]] of 1 Samuel 29:4 and 1 Kings 5:18 - [http://books.google.com/books?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC&pg=PA651&lpg=PA651&dq=Berlin+Grossman%22misinterpretation+of+is%22&source=bl&ots=d8F76bcDpU&sig=NjFhmaLG71fErwgVMcTV0rT-gDI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yvwEUMupK8fs2QXJ17yaBQ&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Berlin%20Grossman%22misinterpretation%20of%20is%22&f=false Oxford dictionary of the Jewish religion, 2011, p.651] "Satan is rarely mentioned in tannaitic literature; later, chiefly Babylonian, aggadah enlarges the scope of his influence and activities.

[[Micaiah]]'s "lying spirit" in 1 Kings 22:22 is sometimes related. Thus, Satan is personified as a character in three different places of the [[Tenakh]], serving as an accuser (Zechariah 3:1-2), a seducer (1 Chronicles 21:1), or as a heavenly persecutor who is "among the sons of God" (Job 2:1). In any case, Satan is always subordinate to the power of God, having a role in the divine plan. Satan is rarely mentioned in [[Tannaim|Tannaitic]] literature, but is found in Babylonian [[aggadah]].<ref name="Oxford,651">{{cite book|last=Berlin|first=editor in chief, Adele|title=The Oxford dictionary of the Jewish religion|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0199730040|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC&pg=PA651&lpg=PA651&dq=Berlin+Grossman%22misinterpretation+of+is%22&source=bl&ots=d8F76bcDpU&sig=NjFhmaLG71fErwgVMcTV0rT-gDI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yvwEUMupK8fs2QXJ17yaBQ&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Berlin%20Grossman%22misinterpretation%20of%20is%22&f=false|edition=2nd ed.|page=651}}</ref>

In [[Christianity]], there are many synonyms for Satan. The most common English synonym for "Satan" is "[[Devil]]", which descends from [[Middle English]] ''devel,'' from [[Old English]] ''dēofol,'' that in turn represents an early [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] borrowing of [[Latin]] ''diabolus'' (also the source of "diabolical"). This in turn was borrowed from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''diabolos'' "[[Defamation|slander]]er", from ''diaballein'' "to slander": ''dia-'' "across, through" + ''ballein'' "to hurl".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/94/D0179400.html| title=American Heritage Dictionary: Devil| accessdate=2006-05-31}}</ref> In the New Testament, "Satan" occurs more than 30 times in passages alongside ''Diabolos'' (Greek for "the devil"), referring to the same person or thing as Satan.<ref>{{bibleverse||Revelation|12:9}}</ref>

[[Beelzebub]], meaning "Lord of Flies", is the contemptuous name given in the Hebrew Bible and New Testament to a [[Philistine]] god whose original name has been reconstructed as most probably "Ba'al Zabul", meaning "[[Baal]] the Prince".<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=dictionary+of+deities+and+demons+in+the+bible&source=bl&ots=aFuwiVr__w&sig=dgryS2h8rvfnVFSI1tdAHwDWl50&hl=en&ei=mP09TdbpGcPBcYit3IUH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=Baalzebub&f=false K. van der Toorn, Bob Becking, Pieter Willem van der Horst, ''Baalzebub'', "Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible", p.155]</ref>

Satan is traditionally identified as the [[serpent (Bible)|serpent]] who tempted [[Eve]] to eat the [[forbidden fruit]]; thus, Satan has often been depicted as a serpent. [[Justin Martyr]], who was born around 100 C.E., was the first to postulate this association. According to Kelly, Justin makes this association "casually", without giving an explanation for his reasoning. In Chapters 45 and 79 of ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'', Justin identifies Satan and the Serpent, asserting that he tempted humankind for "an unspecified sinful reason" and was cursed as a result.<ref name=":0">Kelly, Harry Ansgar (2007). ''Satan: a Biography''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p.&nbsp;176. ISBN&nbsp;978-0-521-84339-3.</ref> However, after Justin, the idea was promulgated by his student Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch, and somewhat later by [[Tertullian]].<ref>Kelly, Harry Ansgar (2007). ''Satan: a Biography''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p.&nbsp;177. ISBN 978-0-521-84339-3.</ref>

From the fourth century, [[Lucifer]] is sometimes used in Christian theology to refer to Satan, as a result of identifying the fallen "son of the dawn" of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 14:12 with the "accuser" of other passages in the Old Testament.
[[File:DVinfernoLuciferKingOfHell m.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Satan as depicted in [[Cocytus|the Ninth Circle of Hell]] in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]],'' illustrated by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

Other terms identified with Satan include "murderer from the beginning" and "he is a liar and the father of lies" in the [[Book of John]] 8:44, "the prince of this world" in the [[Book of John]] 12:31, 14:30; "the prince of the power of the air" also called Meririm, and "the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience" in the [[Book of Ephesians]] 2:2; and "the god of this world" in [[2 Corinthians]] 4:4.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|4:4}}</ref>

The [[Book of Revelation]] twice refers to "the [[dragon]], that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan" (12:9, 20:2). The Book of Revelation also refers to "the deceiver", from which is derived the common epithet "the great deceiver".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mun.ca/rels/restmov/texts/bjohnson/hg1/PNT27-20.HTM|title= The Revelation of John.

In traditional Christian understanding of the holy Hebrew scriptures, the [[Torah]], Satan is a synonym for the Devil. For most Christians, he is believed to be an angel who rebelled against God, and also the one who spoke through the serpent and seduced Eve into disobeying God's command. His ultimate goal is to lead people away from the love of God; i.e., to lead them to fallacies which God opposes. Satan is also identified as the accuser of [[Book of Job|Job]], the tempter in the [[Gospels]], the secret power of lawlessness in {{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:7}}, and the dragon in the Book of Revelation. Before his insurrection, Satan was among the highest of all angels and the "[[Lucifer|brightest in the sky]]". His pride is considered a reason why he would not bow to God as all other angels did, but sought to rule heaven himself.

However, the popularly held beliefs that Satan was once an angel who became prideful and eventually rebelled against God are not portrayed explicitly in the Bible, and are mostly based on inference (e.g., [[Ezekiel]] 28 and [[Isaiah]] 14:12–17). In mainstream Christianity, he is called "the ruler of the demons" ([[Book of Matthew|Matthew]] 12:24), "the ruler of the world", and "the god of this world" (2 Cor. 4:4). The Book of Revelation describes how Satan will be cast out of Heaven, down to the earth, having "great anger" and waging war against "those who obey God's commandments and hold to the testimony of [[Jesus]]". Ultimately, Satan is thrown into the "[[lake of fire]]", not as ruler, but as one among many, being tormented day and night forever and ever.<ref>{{bibleref|Revelation|20:10}}</ref>

The early Christian church encountered opposition from pagans such as [[Celsus]], who claimed that "it is blasphemy...to say that the greatest God...has an adversary who constrains his capacity to do good" and said that Christians "impiously divide the kingdom of God, creating a rebellion in it, as if there were opposing factions within the divine, including one that is hostile to God".<ref>{{cite book|author=Origen|title=Contra Celsum|at=Book 6. Ch 42|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen166.html}}
</ref>

In other Christian beliefs (e.g., the beliefs of the [[Devil in Christianity#Christadelphians|Christadelphians]]), the word "satan" in the Bible is not regarded as referring to a supernatural, personal being but to any "adversary" and figuratively refers to human sin and temptation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/devil.htm |title=Do you Believe in a Devil? |accessdate=2007-05-29 }}</ref>

==Islam==
{{Main|Devil (Islam)}}
{{see also|Azazel#Azazel in Islam}}
''[[Shaitan]]'' (شيطان) is the equivalent of Satan in [[Islam]]. While ''Shaitan'' (شيطان, from the root {{unicode|šṭn شط⁬ن}}) is an [[adjective]] (meaning "astray" or "distant", sometimes translated as "devil") that can be applied to both [[man]] ("al-ins", الإنس) and [[Jinn]], [[Iblis]] ({{IPA-ar|ˈibliːs}}) is the personal name of the Devil who is mentioned in the [[Qur'an]]ic account of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].<ref>[http://www.themystica.org/mystica/articles/i/iblis.html Iblis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> According to the Qur'an, Iblis (the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name used) disobeyed an order from [[God in Islam|Allah]] to bow to Adam, and as a result Iblis was forced out of heaven. However, he was given respite from further punishment until the [[Islamic eschatology|day of judgment]].

When Allah commanded all of the angels to bow down before Adam (the first Human), Iblis, full of [[hubris]] and jealousy, refused to obey God's command (he could do so because he had [[Predestination in Islam|free will]]), seeing Adam as being inferior in creation due to his being created from clay as compared to him (created of fire).<ref>{{quran-usc|17|61}}; {{quran-usc|2|34}}</ref>

{{quote|It is We Who created you and gave you shape; then We bade the angels prostrate to Adam, and they prostrate; not so Iblis (Lucifer); He refused to be of those who prostrate.

(Allah) said: "What prevented thee from prostrating when I commanded thee?" He said: "I am better than he: Thou didst create me from fire, and him from clay."|Qur'an 7:11–12}}

It was after this that the title of "Shaitan" was given, which can be roughly translated as "Enemy", "Rebel", "Evil", or "Devil". Shaitan then claims that, if the punishment for his act of disobedience is to be delayed until the Day of Judgment, then he will divert many of Adam's own descendants from the straight path during his period of respite.<ref>{{quran-usc|17|62}}</ref> God accepts the claims of Iblis and guarantees recompense to Iblis and his followers in the form of Hellfire. In order to test mankind and jinn alike, Allah allowed Iblis to roam the earth to attempt to convert others away from his path.<ref>{{quran-usc|17|63–64}}</ref> He was sent to earth along with [[Adam and Eve]], after eventually luring them into eating the fruit from the [[Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil|forbidden tree]].<ref>{{quran-usc|7|20–22}}</ref>

==Yazidism==
An alternative name for the main deity in the tentatively [[Indo-European]] pantheon of the [[Yazidi]], [[Malek Taus]], is Shaitan.<ref>Drower, E.S. The Peacock Angel. Being Some Account of Votaries of a Secret Cult and their Sanctuaries. London: John Murray, 1941. [http://www.avesta.org/yezidi/peacock.htm]</ref> However, rather than being Satanic, Yazidism is better understood as a remnant of a pre-Islamic [[Middle East]]ern Indo-European religion, and/or a [[ghulat]] [[Sufi]] movement founded by [[Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir|Shaykh Adi]]. The connection with Satan, originally made by Muslim outsiders, attracted the interest of 19th century [[Europe]]an travelers and esoteric writers.

==Bahá'í Faith==
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], ''Satan'' is not regarded as an independent evil power as he is in some faiths, but signifies the ''lower nature'' of humans.

==Satanism==
{{Main|Satanism}}

Satanic groups have various opinions about Satan, ranging from the conviction that he exists and ought to be worshipped ([[theistic Satanism]]), to [[Anton Szandor LaVey]]'s symbolic interpretation, which emphasizes individual will and pleasure-seeking. In theistic Satanism, Satan is considered a positive force and deity who is either worshipped or revered.<ref>''Satanism and Demonology'', by Lionel & Patricia Fanthorpe, [[Dundurn Press]], 8 Mar 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=vXs7AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PT74&dq=Theistic%20satanism&pg=PT74#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 74, "If, as theistic Satanists believe, the devil is an intelligent, self-aware entity..." "Theistic Satanism then becomes explicable in terms of Lucifer's ambition to be the supreme god and his rebellion against Yahweh. &#91;...&#93; This simplistic, controntational view is modified by other theistic Satanists who do not regard their hero as evil: far from it.  For them he is a freedom fighter..."]</ref> In [[LaVeyan Satanism]], Satan is regarded as holding virtuous characteristics.<ref>Contemporary religious Satanism: a critical anthology - Page 45, Jesper Aagaard Petersen - 2009</ref>

Among non-Satanists, much modern Satanic folklore does not originate with the beliefs or practices of theistic or LeVeyan Satanists, but a mixture of medieval Christian folk beliefs, political or sociological conspiracy theories, and contemporary urban legends.<ref>''Cinema of the Occult: New Age, Satanism, Wicca, and Spiritualism in Film'', Carrol Lee Fry, Associated University Presse, 2008, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LylaC3ZxSbAC&lpg=PA93&dq=satanic%20lore%20christian%20urban%20legends&pg=PA92#v=onepage&q&f=false p.92-98]</ref><ref name="EncycUrbLeg">''Encyclopedia of Urban Legends, Updated and Expanded Edition'', by Jan Harold Brunvand, ABC-CLIO, 31 Jul 2012 [http://books.google.com/books?id=ubT7rPmPdpoC&lpg=PT555&dq=satanic%20lore%20christian%20urban%20legends&pg=PT694#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 694-695]</ref><ref name="Ellis">Raising the Devil: Satanism, New Religions, and the Media'', by Bill Ellis, University Press of Kentucky [http://books.google.com/books?id=oLcqlypMCe8C&lpg=PA303&dq=satanic%20lore%20christian%20urban%20legends&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q&f=false p.125] In discussing myths about groups accused of Satanism, "...such myths are already pervasive in Western culture, and the development of the modern "Satanic Scare" would be impossible to explain without showing how these myths helped organize concerns and beliefs."  Accusations of Satanism are traced from the witch hunts, to the Illuminati, to the Satanic Ritual Abuse panic in the 1980s, with a distinction made between what modern Satanists believe and what is believed about Satanists.</ref><ref name="SatAm">''Satan in America: The Devil We Know'', by W.
